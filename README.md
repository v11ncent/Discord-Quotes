# Purpose
Sometimes we say funny things in Discord. I want to remember them.
## Current priority
Trying to make the website mobile responsive
## Future iterations
Add context logging to quotes, as well as a website redesign
### Backend folder
For some reason, since the backend folder is a Heroku repository as well, it won't let you open it. Trying to fix soon (soon is subjective).
